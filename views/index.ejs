      <h3>My Favorite Subject</h3>
      <p>
        One of my favorite subjects is astronomy, a field that has captivated my imagination with the vastness and
        mysteries of the universe. The study of celestial bodies, such as stars, planets, galaxies, and beyond, has
        always fascinated me. Astronomy allows me to explore the cosmos, unraveling the secrets of the night sky and
        understanding the fundamental forces that govern the universe. From the awe-inspiring beauty of distant nebulae
        to the intricate dance of planets in our solar system, every aspect of astronomy sparks my curiosity. Delving
        into the wonders of space not only provides a profound sense of wonder but also encourages me to contemplate our
        place in the grand tapestry of existence. Whether observing celestial events through a telescope, studying the
        latest astronomical discoveries, or simply contemplating the night sky, my fascination with astronomy continues
        to grow, making it a subject that continually inspires and captivates me.
